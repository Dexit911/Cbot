Problems:
With time, my code started to look messy. The class itself did not handle the right things. My TradingLogic was handling
too much stuff in same place, I needed to separate testing ground, indicators, and algorithms.

Thoughts:
I need a setup that is easy to use. I want to be able to add new strategies without changing the test ground. I want the
strategies decide which indicators should be applied to the base DataFrame. I want the test ground to be easy adjustable.

Saving Data:
So much data needs to be extracted its crazy. I am thinking about moving the calculation of data in separate place.
And I came upp with a new idea how to structure the results.
Structure example:

Test_name/
    summary.csv   <- Here we have base information about the overall test.
    full_sector/  <- We also have information about every sector for deeper understanding.
        data.csv  <- Contains all the parameters of the test.
        chart.png <- Picture of a chart for visual understanding, mpf format.
    sector1/
        data.csv
        chart.png
    ...

Solved:
After a lot of work, I am almost done with the new architecture for my testing engine. Today my project got a new shape.
New classes:
TestRunner() - Runs the simulation with given data and strategies. Very adjustable attributes.
BaseStrategy() - A parent class for all future trading logic. Sets up settings for algorithms with given config
RSIstrategy() - Algorithm based on RSI indicators with adjustable settings.
IdicatorManager() - applies indicators to Dataframe based on params from the same config that strategy uses

Plans:
The new system has a lot of bugs, so today I am trying to make it work properly. A lot of debugging!
Thinking about adding more error handling for a safer environment, with prints and other stuff.

Todo:
*Define sectors' trend – bull, bear, side.
*Start with Bollinger Bands strategy, make a deeper research into the formula and how to use it.
*Combine Bollinger Bands with RSI. Make them support each other.
*Start working on the data structure and MAYBE make a new class for that.

Solved:
It was a very big surprise for me that my new code had only one bug! So now I have a fully working and adjustable
testing environment. Today I started working on structuring data and saving it. I created a new class: DataManager. It
handles all data saving by getting only a list with sector results. The file saving itself is done. The hardest part
is data calculation. My solution is another class for calculation: DataCalculator, which only contains static calculation
methods.

Work thoughts:
I am always trying to make the code readable and commented, because I know that in some time, the data manager is going
to get an upgrade. I am messing up attributes and variable names. Naming needs to have rules and be more strict — this
project is getting big. So I need to put some visual standards in place for my code.

Problem to solve for next time:
I found out that some calculations need data that I am not passing to DataManager. I need to find some way to get it
without messing up the clean logic. Maybe I will adjust the data that my testing ground is sending. I still
haven’t made another indicator. As soon as I am done with data managing, I am going to start training my bot.

What was done:
I got done with DataManager, what it does: Structures the data, saves the results for every test.
New class: DataCalculator, some static methods for simple calculation.
I removed: CsvLogger, felt like it was not neccesary. Maybe I am going to bring it back later.

Thoughts:
Does the DataManager handles right things? Do I do it in the right way?
Do I need to make up another class for saving files?

Plans:
Remove some data for showcase.
Define sectors label and add it to sector data. Label ex: Bull, Bear and side.
Add signals and visual representation of trades on candle charts.
Start working on bollinger bands indicators.

Work thoughts:
I shall remove all calculation logic from the test class. I also started with writing mini documentation about every
method and function.
